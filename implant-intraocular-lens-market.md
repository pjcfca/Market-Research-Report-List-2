<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Implant Intraocular Lens Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Non-foldable Lenses</li><li>Foldable Intraocular Lens</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-foldable intraocular lenses are rigid and cannot be folded during implantation, requiring a larger incision for insertion. They are typically made of materials like PMMA. Foldable intraocular lenses, on the other hand, are flexible and can be folded, allowing for a smaller incision and easier implantation. They are usually made of materials like silicone or acrylic. Foldable lenses are preferred by both surgeons and patients due to their minimally invasive nature and quicker recovery time.</p></p>

<p><strong>The Implant Intraocular Lens Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrophilic</li><li>Hydrophobic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Implant intraocular lens market applications include hydrophilic and hydrophobic lenses. Hydrophilic lenses are known for their ability to absorb water and provide a smooth surface for better vision. They are often favored for their biocompatibility and reduced risk of inflammation. On the other hand, hydrophobic lenses repel water and are preferred for their resistance to deposits and easier maintenance. Both types of lenses cater to different patient needs and are used in cataract surgery for vision correction.</p></p>
