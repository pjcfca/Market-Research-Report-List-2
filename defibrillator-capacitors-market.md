<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Defibrillator Capacitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monophasic Defibrillator Capacitor</li><li>Biphasic Defibrillator Capacitor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Defibrillator capacitors are classified into two types based on the waveform they produce: monophasic and biphasic. Monophasic defibrillator capacitors deliver a single shock of electrical energy in the opposite direction of the heartbeat, while biphasic defibrillator capacitors deliver a shock in two directions. Biphasic defibrillators are considered more efficient and have become the standard in modern defibrillators due to their ability to deliver effective shocks at lower energy levels, making them safer for patients.</p></p>
