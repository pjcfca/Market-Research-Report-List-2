<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Volumetric Display Screen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Static Volume</li><li>Swept Volume</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Volumetric display screens are classified into two main types - static volume and swept volume. Static volume displays create three-dimensional images by illuminating points within a fixed volume of space, allowing viewers to see the image from various angles. Swept volume displays, on the other hand, project images by sweeping a narrow beam of light through space, creating the illusion of a solid shape. Both types of volumetric displays offer unique visual experiences and are used in various industries such as entertainment, healthcare, and education.</p></p>
