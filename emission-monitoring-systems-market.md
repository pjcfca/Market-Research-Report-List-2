<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Emission Monitoring Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Predictive Emission Monitoring Systems</li><li>Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Emission Monitoring Systems are categorized into two main types - Predictive Emission Monitoring Systems (PEMS) and Continuous Emission Monitoring Systems (CEMS). PEMS use mathematical models to predict emissions based on process variables, while CEMS continuously monitor emissions in real-time. PEMS are cost-effective and flexible, but may not always provide accurate data. On the other hand, CEMS offer accurate and reliable emission data but are typically more expensive to install and maintain. Both types play a crucial role in helping industries monitor and reduce their emissions.</p></p>
