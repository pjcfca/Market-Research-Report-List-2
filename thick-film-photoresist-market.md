<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Thick Film Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresists</li><li>Negative Photoresists</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Thick film photoresist market includes two main types: Positive photoresists and Negative photoresists. Positive photoresists are formulated to be sensitive to UV light, becoming more soluble when exposed. This allows for easy removal of the exposed areas during development. Negative photoresists, on the other hand, become insoluble when exposed to UV light, making the unexposed areas easier to remove during development. These different types cater to various applications and requirements in the semiconductor and electronics industries.</p></p>
