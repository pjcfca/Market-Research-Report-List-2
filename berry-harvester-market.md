<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Berry Harvester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Half-row Harvester</li><li>Full-row Harvester</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Berry harvesters can be categorized into two main types: half-row harvesters and full-row harvesters. Half-row harvesters are designed to harvest berries from only one side of the row, typically used in smaller or more specialized berry farming operations. On the other hand, full-row harvesters are capable of harvesting berries from both sides of the row simultaneously, making them more efficient for larger commercial berry farms. Each type of harvester has its own advantages and is chosen based on the specific needs of the operation.</p></p>
