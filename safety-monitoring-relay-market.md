<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Safety Monitoring Relay Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Normally Open</li><li>Normally Closed</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Safety monitoring relays come in two main types: Normally Open and Normally Closed. </p><p>Normally Open safety monitoring relays have contacts that are open when the relay is in its default state. These relays close the contacts when a fault or unsafe condition is detected, sending a signal to shut down the machinery or equipment.</p><p>On the other hand, Normally Closed safety monitoring relays have contacts that are closed when the relay is in its default state. These relays open the contacts when a fault or unsafe condition is detected, triggering a shutdown signal.</p></p>
