<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Industrial Cooling Fans Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Fans</li><li>Axial Fans</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Industrial cooling fans can be categorized into two main types: centrifugal fans and axial fans. Centrifugal fans work by increasing the speed of the air stream through the fan blades and then slowing it down as it leaves the fan, creating a high-pressure system. Axial fans, on the other hand, work by drawing air parallel to the axis of the fan blades, creating a low-pressure system. Both types of fans are commonly used in various industrial applications for cooling purposes.</p></p>
